# Manga Tree

Firefox add-on to check if the bookmarked manga has new update.

## Introduction
Some of the nice online manga like mangatown.com do not have a very nice way to show updates. 
And some, display friendly enough for me to go checkout everyday because the updates are listed by date.

The problem is, once you read a lot of manga and updates are sometimes take weeks or months than you lose track
of them.

Many of the online manga site is plague with annoying ads and they are not working when adblock or uBlock installed. 
This add-on helps to avoid to visit the website if there is not update available.

By the way, mango is _manga_ in Malaysia and Indonesian national language.
Hence manga tree is Mango Tree.


## How it works
1. Search through bookmarks
2. Look for the supported mangasite
3. Within each manga find the latest and remove duplicate
4. Sort order by name
5. Display list 
6. Click on the list to open the last bookmark manga
