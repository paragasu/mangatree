Search through bookmarks\r\n2. Look for the supported mangasite\r\n3. Within each manga find the latest and remove duplicate\r\n4. Sort order by name\r\n5. Display list \r\n6. Click on the list to open the last bookmark manga\r\n\r\n\r\n## Supported manga\r\n- [x] mangahen.com\r\n- [x] mangareader.net\r\n- [x] mangatown.com\r\n- [x] mangahere.co\r\n- [ ] mangafox.com\r\n\r\nIf you find any interesting mangasite and you wish Manga Tree to support it.\r\nPlease drop me a message.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n- [ ] Cache result on offline\r\n- [ ] Automatically check status every 1 hours or so\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\n```\r\n#npm install -g jpm\r\n\r\n$git clone https://github.com/paragasu/mangatree.git\r\n$cd mangatree\r\n$jpm run\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
